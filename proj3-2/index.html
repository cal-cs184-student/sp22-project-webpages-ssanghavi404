    <p>In this project, we added additional functionality to our Pathtracer from Project 3-1 to allow for different
      surfaces
      of objects in our scene. In the previous part of the project, most of our objects had a Lambertian diffuse
      surface,
      which meant that any incoming light would bounce off equally in all directions. In this project, we added
      functionality for surfaces like mirrors that would reflect light directly opposite the angle of incidence, or
      glass
      through which light could refract. In addition to mirror and glass materials, we implemented the Microfacet BSDF,
      which allows us to use an alpha parameter to control the "roughness" of the surface. The main challenges we faced
      were
      making sure to implement the equations that model light behavior correctly (ex. Snell's Law, Fresnel Equations) as
      well as the equations to model the microfacet surface—thankfully, it ended up being relatively easy to debug since
      we
      worked out all the closed-form solutions with paper and pencil beforehand, and all we had to do was to make sure
      we
      correctly translated those equations into code.</p>
    <h1 align="middle">Task 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h1>
    <p>
      In this task, we implemented rendering of of two simple non-lambertian BSDFs: mirror and glass surfaces.
      We implemented two helper
      functions that output a wi given a wo: reflect and refract. Reflection was done in local
      coordinates which means that reflecting a ray means reflecting across the z axis.
      Refraction was a bit more complicated. In order to implement refraction, we had to consider a few
      possibilities. We first determined whether the ray was entering or exiting the object, using the dot product
      between wo and the normal (again in localized coordinates). We use Snell's Law to test if there is total internal
      reflection, and if not we update wi.

      To sample mirror and refractive surfaces, we utilize the above helper functions. For glass BSDF
      we must account for the cosine of the reflected ray and return:
    <pre align="middle">reflectance / abs_cos(wi)</pre>
    Similarly, for refraction, we return
    <pre align="middle">transmittance / abs_cos(wi) / eta^2</pre>
    </br>
    </br>
    Lastly, we combine refraction and reflection to sample from glass objects. If there is total internal
    reflection, we use reflect to calculate wi. Otherwise, we compute Schlick's coefficient as an approximation for the
    Fresnel Equations, and call our helper functions to perform
    reflection with probability R, else refraction. We update the pdf respectively.

    <h3>Mirror and Glass Spheres, varying the max ray depth</h3>
    <p>The images below show a scene with one mirror sphere and one glass sphere, varying the maximum number of
      surface-air interactions ("bounces") that a ray can take. Note that a light ray hitting glass from the air is
      considered a "bounce". </p>

    </div>

    <p>Let's look at some of the visual effects varying the max number of bounces.</p>
    <b>m = 0</b> We are only able to see the light sources (ie zero bounce illumination). Nothing too interesting here.
    </br>
    </br>

    <b>m = 1</b> We cannot see the whole spheres (ie. they are black). We see the walls (as light reflects directly from
    the light off the walls into the viewer) and we see the reflection of the light source on the spheres.
    Note that mirror sphere has a clear single-bounce reflection of the light source itself, while the glass also has a
    slightly fainter reflection.
    </br>
    </br>

    <b>m = 2</b> In this scene, we can start to make out the contents of the mirror and glass spheres.
    The mirror shows the room, and a black ball representing the glass sphere (This is equal to the visualization of the
    glass sphere with m = 1). For all future steps, the glass ball shown in the mirror will be equal to the glass ball
    with 1 less bounce, because one bounce will hit the mirror and m - 1 bounces will be left once it hits the glass
    ball.
    The glass ball shows a faint, reflection of the room. Most refracted rays are not yet visible with 2 bounces because
    we consider the refraction as a light ray enters and exits the material as two separate bounces.
    Both of the spheres are dark due to limited bounces to collect light.

    </br>
    </br>

    <b>m = 3</b> In this scene, we can see a representation of what the spheres should actually look like. Now,
    both reflection and refraction rays are being captured in the glass sphere. We can note the white light
    at the bottom of the glass sphere due to rays that refract through the glass, then are reflected off the ground into
    the viewer. This takes three bounces, because a refracted
    ray has to enter then exit the glass sphere before bouncing off the ground. The reflected glass sphere on the mirror
    sphere is still dark since it is from one less bounce, as mentioned earlier. Both scenes are brighter.
    </br>
    </br>

    <b>m = 4</b> At m = 4, we can see the glass ball (as represented at m = 3) within the mirror ball.
    Additionally, we can see that there is a spot of
    light on the right hand side wall generated from the glass ball. This is from light rays that reflects off the
    mirror, refract through the sphere and goes onto the wall, then finally reflect off the wall and into the viewer.
    </br>
    </br>

    <b>m = 5</b> Between m = 4 and m = 5, it is hard to tell big differences between the images. To me this means that
    there have been adequate bounces of light to represent most if not all of the features of the glass and
    mirror spheres. The only difference is that m = 5 in generally brighter due to the extra bounce rays that are now
    being considered.
    </br>
    </br>

    <b>m = 100</b> At m = 100, we can see that the image gets brighter as there is more bounces to collect light.
    We do not see the the grainy particles scattered across the scene decrease as we did in the previous part.
    This is probably because these spots may not be due to lack of sampling, but due to random reflected and
    refracted bounces.


    <h1 align="middle">Task 2: Microfacet Material</h1>
    <p>
      For this task, we implemented microfacet materials to render smooth and rough isotropic matals. To
      calculate the evaluation for a given BRDF and ray, we need the Fresnel term, normal distribution
      function, shadow-masking term, and halfvector h.

      We model normal distribution function using Beckmann's distribution with parameter theta_h (of the halfvector),
      and use a hyperparameter alpha which controls smoothness of the surface. Small alpha means the object is closer to
      a smooth mirror, while larger alpha means the object is closer to a rough surface.

      The fresnel term is computed for the R, G, and B values seperately as eta and k have independent
      values for each of the three values. We can then plug in the eta, k, and theta values to the
      air-conductor Fresnel equations.

      Lastly, we perform importance sampling to sample with respect to the Beckmann integration curve.
      In this integration, we need to sample two random variables between 0 and 1. We can then use the
      formulas provided to get theta and phi and can then reconstruct the vector h using these values, converting
      spherical coordinates to rectangular:
    <pre align="center">h.x = cos(phi_h) * sin(theta_h)</pre>
    <pre align="center">h.y = sin(phi_h) * sin(theta_h)</pre>
    <pre align="center">h.z = cos(theta_h)</pre>

    We can also calculate the incident ray corresponding to a reflected ray. Using the fact that the angle of incidence
    matches the angle of reflection and doing some vector algebra, we obtain:
    <pre align="center">wi = 2(wo ⋅ h)h  − wo</pre>

    Finally, we have to update the PDF of the sample. We also ensure the dot product of wo, n and wi, n
    are both greater than 0, otherwise return an empty vector3d.

      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      As we change the alpha parameter, we are changing the roughness of the BSDF. An alpha value of 0.005 will
      represent a very smooth material, while 0.5 will be rougher. This roughness can be visualized by graphing
      the Beckmann distribution with different values of alpha. Qualatatively, the smoother images with smaller
      alphas look more glossy, but also darker. Another interesting effect is when alpha is very low, it looks
      one can see pixels of light that bounced off of the dragon bsdf on the walls. As we increase alpha, we can
      see that the dragon itself looks more matte, but brighter as well.

    <h3>Bunny with copper microfacet, varying sampling rate</h3>
    <div align="center">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td align="middle">
            <img src="images/bunny_hemisphere.png" width="480px" />
            <figcaption align="middle">uniform hemisphere sampling</figcaption>

            <figcaption align="middle">importance sampling</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Using uniform hemisphere sampling, we run into a similar problem as we had in the first pathtracer project.
      In this situation, we are not sampling important values to the normal distribution function. Hence, a lot
      of the samples that we generate may have a small weight or probability of actually occuring. As a result, in the
      images shown, the hemisphere sampling example tends to be grainy, but captures the main features of the bunny,
      such as the brightness on the top and bottom of the bunny.
      </br>
      </br>
      To contrast, in the second example we use important sampling using the inverse of the Beckmann distribution.
      This means that the samples we choose from are more likely to be important values with respect to the PDF.
      We no longer need as many samples per pixel, and instead, the same number of samples can give a much smoother
      result. We continue to see the reflections such as the light from the top of the room shine on the bunny, and
      darker spots that may be in the shadow of the light.

    <p align="left">
      As a partner project, this was a very collaborative experience and we needed to rely on one another to
      get the project working. Both of us met up on Zoom to worked on the
      project and worked on Saagar's computer, since Rishi's computer had the Apple M1 Chip and couldn't run the
      staff-provided binary files. Towards the end, Saagar focused on
      generating high-quality images while Rishi focused on completing the writeup.
