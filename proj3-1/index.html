    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <div class="padded">
        <p>In this project, we implemented a ray tracer to render realistic-looking images of scenes with objects and
            light sources. Ray Tracing is a technique where a computer program uses basic mathematical models of
            geometric optics to follow the paths of light rays and see how they would be seen by a viewer at a fixed
            position in the scene. There were 5 parts of this project. In Part 1 we generated camera rays and calculated
            ray-scene intersections with the camera rays and the
            scene intersections using the tools of vector analysis. In Part 2 we accelerated ray-scene interesection
            using a Bounding Volume Hierarcy, which allowed logarithmic-time lookup of our scene objects and thus sped
            up the rendering process. In Part 3, we traced the light rays that would hit the camera through zero-bounce
            or one-bounce paths; this required implementing the diffuse BSDF to model the bounce of surfaces, and
            importance sampling of the lights to speed up how many samples we needed to take to get accurate renderings.
            In part 4 we solved the global illumination problem, which aimed to model all possible bounces of light
            through the scene, with exponential decay in intensity at each bounce. While it was infeasible to try to
            trace infinitely many bounces of light, we could use the Russian Roulette technique of probabilistically
            killing a ray to get an unbiased estimate of the up-to-infinite bounces of light. In part 5, we sped up our
            implementation of global illumination using adaptive sampling, which calculates a 95% confidence interval of
            our perceived intensity every few samples, and if the variance is small, we assume the light intensity has
            converged and avoid additional sampling.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main challenges we faced in implementing this project were debugging our ray tracing algorithm for one
            or more bounces of light in a scene. We had to make sure to be careful with which intersections the ray
            encountered, and set everything up correctly when making the recursive call. Also, when importance sampling
            the lights, we needed to make sure that if a reflected camera ray actually hit something else before hitting
            the light, it shouldn't get the luminance from the light. While it was easy to grasp many of these concepts
            at a high level, we neeeded to make sure to consider all the edge cases and implementation details when
            turning the ideas into code.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
        <p>To generate camera rays, we need to construct vectors between the points of the camera origin to the
            coordinate positions on the image. We have to convert these rays from the camera space coordinates to the
            world coordinates, then trace these rays through our 3D scenes and identify intersections with objects. To
            choose which parts of a pixel to trace a ray through, we sample positions at random.</p>

        <p> Once we had generated the camera rays through the pixel samples, we traced these rays through our scene and
            determined if they collided with any objects. Specifically, we needed to implement the equations for the
            ray-triangle intersection and the ray-sphere intersection. While the equations for ray-sphere intersection
            are quite easy to derive from the equation of a sphere, the ray-triangle intersection proved to be a bit
            trickier. </p>

        <p> The triangle intersection algorithm was similar to the algorithm that was introduced in
            discussion section. We first identify a point on a triangle in terms of its Barycentric coordinates and set
            up a system of equations for [t, b1, b2], where t is the varying parameter of the ray and (1 - b1 - b2, b1,
            b2) are the barycentric coordinates of an aribtrary point in the triangle. We'd get 3 equations (one from
            each of the x, y, and z coordinates of the point of intersection) and thus can solve the simultaneous
            equations using matrix inversion (provided that the matrix is invertibleâ€”if not, this means the ray misses
            the plane entirely). Using the values we get for (t, b1, b2), we can check that (1 - b1 - b2, b1, b2) all
            lie within the [0, 1] range (ie. the point is actually on the triangle) and that our t > 0 (ie. we are on
            positive side of the ray) to determine if the ray hits the triangle, and if so we know where.
        </p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>A Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is a data structure to accelerate ray tracing in scenes, which uses a tree
            structure of the objects present in the scene in order to facilitate quick lookup based on
            location. This way, when tracing rays through our scene, we can quickly identify ray-scene intersections
            based on the positions of the objects rather than have to iterate over all objects in our scene. To
            construct a BVH of the objects in the scene, our approach was to first choose an axis along which to split,
            then identify the value along that axis where we split.
        </p>

        <p>
            We chose to use axis with the largest dimension bounding box as the axis along which to split. Along this
            axis, we chose the split value based on the average of the centroids of all the objects within that group.
            Once we had a split point, we partitioned our list of objects into these two groups based on where the
            object's centroid was relative to the split point. We then recursively call our function to construct the
            BVH down to the base case where we have just a few
            objects left (less than max_leaf_size) left in each leaf node.
        </p>
        <h3> Large scenes only renderable with BVH </h3>

        <p>Note that the scenes rendered below were infeasible for us to render without the BVH since they have very
            complex mesh structures which would take prohibitively too long to render. They could only be rended with
            the BVH acceleration. </p>

        <p>The rendering times with the BVH acceleration were always much faster than the rendering time without using
            the BVH. This is because without the BVH, any ray-object intersection requires looping through all the
            possible surfaces in the scene, which is inefficient and costly; it takes O(n) time to find something we
            want in our scene. With the BVH, however, the average-case runtime to find an object is reduced to O(log(n))
            because the tree structure allows fast lookups.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
        <p>The direct illumination function considers rays of light that take zero or one bounces to hit the camera.
            For zero-bounce, we just need to trace the a ray from the camera to light sources and consider the amount
            of light emitted from the source.
        </p>
        <p>
            For one-bounce, we need to trace the camera ray through a pixel to its first intersection point with an
            object in the scene, then estimate the total illuminance at that point from light sources in the scene.
            Since computing incident surface illuminance requires integrating the incoming luminance of light coming
            from all directions over the hemisphere, we need to numerically evaluate this integral using Monte Carlo
            Integration, which takes sample directions and calculates the radiance of rays coming from those directions
            hitting the surface.
        </p>

        <p>
            There were two main approaches to performing this Monte Carlo integration. One approach used uniform
            hemisphere sampling, ie. we choose a point at random from the hemisphere and consider the contribution of
            a light ray coming from that direction. However, if there are only a few light sources, this approach may
            generate many rays that contribute little to the actual integral because the reflected camera ray does not
            end up hitting a light source. Thus, an improvement to get more "useful" samples is to perform importance
            sampling, where we sample the light sources directly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our implementation of the direct lighting function with uniform hemisphere sampling first constructs a
            camera ray and identifies the first hit point. Then we take num_samples sample directions and trace them to
            their next intersection. If the next intersection is a light source, we add the radiance contribution to our
            estimate (normalized by the pdf of that direction vector) and divide by num_samples once completed.
        </p>

        <p>For the direct lighting function with importance sampling, we again trace camera rays to the first
            intersection point, but from there rather than take num_samples samples, we iterate over the light sources
            in the scene directly. For point light sources, we add their radiance contributions (normalized by the
            pdf). For area light sources, we take ns_area_light samples in directions that hit the light and add their
            radiance contributions (normalized by both the pdf of the direction and the ns_area_light). In this case, we
            needed to check that we didn't hit another object first as we travel in the direction of the ray, since then
            the other object would occlude the light source. </p>

        <p> For ray tracing, we needed to make sure to start our ray's t parameter at a small "epsilon" parameter to
            avoid hitting our own surface due to floating point precision errors, and also keep a buffer of epsilon
            before the light source to check if there were any other objects in the scene.
        </p>

                Uniform hemisphere sampling requires a much greater number of samples to estimate the true contribution
                of lights, since it may end up sampling many directions which never hit the lights. Importance sampling,
                on the other hand, samples the light sources directly because they are the only things that contribute
                non-zero values to the integral. This is why with the same number samples, importance sampling renders
                much more accurate and less grainy results compared to uniform hemisphere sampling which ends up getting
                lots of samples that we don't care about (since their contribution is 0). Note that because a given
                sample's contribution to the integral is weighted by the reciprocal of probability density function in
                Monte Carlo integration, both uniform hemisphere sampling and importance sampling get approximations

                As we take more samples of the number of light rays cast, we notice that the noise levels decrease. This
                is particularly evident in the soft shadow regions under the sphere. This makes sense, as when we have
                more samples we get a better estimate of the true value of our integral and thus have less noisy images.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
        <p align="left">The global illumination problem aims to trace all possible bounces of light (even if more than 0
            or 1) that
            eventually hit the camera. This turns out to be an converging infinite series sum, since some light is
            disappated at each bounce but there can be an arbitrarily large number of bounces that a light ray
            encounters before making it to the camera. Our implementation considers the zero-bounce radiance (directly
            from light source) and at least bounce radiance. The function for at least one bounce radiance is recursive,
            since it considers the contribution from one bounce directly off the first intersection point, and at least
            one bounce radiance from other points that eventually hit the first intersection point. Since the sum total
            would have infinitely many terms, we terminate when we have traced a ray through more than max_ray_depth
            bounces. We also implemented the Russian Roulette technique to terminate rays, where at each bounce, each
            ray continues with some probability rr_prob and is terminated (killed) otherwise. We add up the
            contributions from the one bounce-radiance at a point and the result of the recursive call (contributions of
            later bounces) to get a final value of the illuminance at a given point. </p>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>
            <p align="left">Adaptive Sampling is a technique to speed up renderings of images. We first estimate the
                mean and
                standard deviation of the luminance along a camera ray using the samples taken so far. Using the
                estimate of standard deviation, if 2 standard deviations (corresponding to a 95% confidence interval) is
                below a certain threshold, then we don't need any more samples and can conclude that the illuminance has
                converged. Our code is able to quickly estimate the mean and SD of the samples taken so far by keeping
                track of the sum and sum of squares of the sample illuminances taken so far. From there, we use the
                simple formulas provided in the project specification to get the estimates. </p>

            <p align="left">
                As a partner project, this was a very collaborative experience and we needed to rely on one another to
                get the project working. Both of us met up in-person and on Zoom most of the times that we worked on the
                project. Pair programming proved to be an effective way for us to catch bugs early and solve problems as
                they arose. Towards the end, Rishi focused on debugging many minor issues with our implementations and
                generating high-quality images while Saagar focused on completing the writeup.
